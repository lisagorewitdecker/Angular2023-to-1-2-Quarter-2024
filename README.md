## How to Clone/Initialize Repository
<b>git clone</b>

Create a Feature Branch and Push To It. You Can Do a Remote Commit With the Following:<br>
<b>git checkout main</b><br>
<b>git pull</b><br>
<b>git checkout -b your_feature_branch_goes_here</b><br>
Make your edits

This Command Will Show You New Files and Confirm What Branch You're On:<br>
<b>git status</b><br>

To See Files Which Have Been Modified or Changed, Use the Command Below:<br>
<b>git diff</b><br>

To Add Files and Stage These Files for Commit:<br>
<b>git add "XYZ"</b> for any new files, e.g. "XYZ".<br>
You may also use the command:<br>
<b>git add . </b>

To Commit: <br>
<b>git commit --all</b><br>
<b>git push origin your_feature_branch_goes_here</b><br>

Then navigate to the pull requests page at github.com within the repository and choose <b>New pull request</b> to create a request to merge your feature branch into main.<br>

When you are ready to Merge your feature branch into main, click the <b>Merge</b> button and let the github website perform the actual change to main. You can then close the source branch on GitHub and delete your local branch with:<br>
<b>git checkout main && git pull && git branch -d your_feature_branch_goes_here</b>

Try to make your feature branch as short and descriptive as possible. If you have to refactor due to your change(s), create one feature branch for refactoring and another that will build on it.
